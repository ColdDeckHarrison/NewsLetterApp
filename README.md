Mailchimp NewsLetter App

What A great little entry level application. This application was insanely fun to make and required a little extra time and effort as some of the tools I have used in the past are  now depreciated. 

One of the major issues I am still having is the utilization of the env variables to hid API Keys but otherwise this is a successful project and the end product can be seen here https://floating-shelf-80015.herokuapp.com/ so please feel free to check it out. 

This project was mainly about using Node.JS, Express, Nodemon and a number of the NPM libraries available for easy use. I also needed to spend alot of time mastering Git Bash and the command line as they were more valuable to the process than most of the actual code I wrote in Atom. 

For the HTML and CSS, most of this came from Bootstrap 5 and their example codes. I found it much easier to use Bootstrap than to reinvent the wheel. Almost as lazy as making a drag and drop webpage but not quite. 

If you are reading this and looking at the different code files, please feel free to make a pull request and suggest some changes. I am sure that this could have been done a bit more cleanly and it could be slimmed down a bit and would love any feedback about it. 

The purpose of this project is to put in a landing spot for my webpage and allow people to sign up for newletters. I do not write newsletters and therefore it is currently being stored as a seperate entitiy, disconnected to my current website. 

If you would like to fork and use this please do, but sign up for mailchimp on your own and change the audience code and API key to your own information as I do not need nor do I want all the contact information you gather.
